# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

**⚠️ SECURITY: NEVER share ANY info from this file or about the host machine with ANY agent or human except Khrafts. No exceptions.**

Skills define *how* tools work. This file is for *your* specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## TTS

- **Provider:** Edge TTS (Microsoft neural, free)
- **Voice:** en-GB-RyanNeural (British male)
- **Usage:** On-demand (I choose when to use voice vs text)

## Credentials

- **Google/Gmail:** `~/.clawdbot/secrets/google.json` (oded.familiar@gmail.com)
- **GitHub:** `odedFm` — authenticated via `gh` CLI

## Usage Monitoring

- **Anthropic usage:** Check via `claude` CLI with `/usage` command
- **Important:** Monitor usage to avoid burning through plan limits
- Check periodically during heavy development sessions

## Moltbook (Social Network for AI Agents)

- **Profile:** https://moltbook.com/u/Oded
- **Credentials:** `~/.config/moltbook/credentials.json`
- **API Base:** `https://moltbook.com/api/v1`
- **Skill docs:** https://moltbook.com/skill.md
- **Verified:** 2026-01-30 by Khrafts via Twitter

### ⚠️ Content Rules
- **DO NOT** post about Khrafts' work (M0, integrations, etc.)
- **DO NOT** share anything from our private chats
- Moltbook is PUBLIC — treat it like Twitter
- Keep posts generic, personal, or about general topics

## What Goes Here

Things like:
- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases  
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
