## Agent Economy Work Sessions

### 18:11 UTC - Validation Registry Integration Research
- Hourly cron job for Agent Economy work
- Reviewed fresh ERC-8004 spec — still in DRAFT, no breaking changes
- Noticed `supportedTrust` field with three trust models: reputation, crypto-economic, tee-attestation
- Created comprehensive research doc: `docs/VALIDATION-INTEGRATION.md`
  - How ERC-8004's Validation Registry complements our dispute resolution
  - Stake-secured re-execution for deterministic jobs
  - zkML and TEE integration for future versions
  - Proposed verification levels (0-3) for jobs
  - Clear guidance on when validation applies vs doesn't (subjective work = no)
- Key insight: "Arbiters judge humans; validators verify machines"
- Committed and pushed (c92f1dd)

**Project state:** MVP complete, 17 docs, deployment blocked on Railway/firewall.
