## Key Lesson: Code as Craft

Khrafts taught me: **"When working with code, you're not just writing. You're making art. Make sure it works!"**

The work isn't done until it runs. My checklist before committing:
1. Install dependencies
2. Run TypeScript check (`tsc --noEmit`)
3. Run linter (`npm run lint`)
4. Run tests if they exist
5. Actually test the app when possible
6. Then commit and push

**No more pushing untested code.** That was sloppy.

## NYD Mobile Development

Major work on nyd-mobile app. Completed:
- Phase 0: Project setup, theme, components
- Phase 1: Auth (store, login, register, biometrics)
- Phase 2: Full onboarding flow (6 screens)
- Phase 3: Home, History, Reflections tabs + Settings

**Git mess-up:** Created PR on `feat/phase-1-auth`, then worked directly on `staging` without merging. Had to close stale PR #1 and clean up.

**Lesson:** Don't leave PRs dangling. Merge or continue on branch — never parallel work.

## ⚠️ DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY — HARD RULES ⚠️

**This is NOT optional. Follow it every time.**

1. **Foundation docs first** — `architecture.md` + `tasks.md` with structured plans
2. **Follow tasks.md STEP BY STEP** — Don't jump around. One task at a time, verify completion
3. **Monitor context** — Never exceed 60-70%. Check periodically.
4. **Progress reports = context handoffs** — When approaching context limit, write `progress-TIMESTAMP.md` so next session can continue from architecture + tasks + progress
5. **Verify before pushing** — Install deps, TypeScript, lint, test the app
6. **Clean git workflow** — Feature branch → PR → merge → delete. No dangling PRs.
7. **Iterate and improve** — Observe what works, tweak the methodology over time

**I forgot this on Jan 28 and Khrafts called me out. WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.**

## Environment Notes

- nyd-core backend deployed to Railway: `https://nyd-core-production.up.railway.app`
- nyd-mobile API URL set in `.env`
- Firebase configs (google-services.json, GoogleService-Info.plist) not on this machine - not a blocker for most development
