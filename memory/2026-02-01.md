## NYD Landing Page - Major Work Session

### Hero Redesign
- Updated copy per Khrafts' direction (D+B approach):
  - Headline: "Your days, captured. Your patterns, revealed."
  - Subtitle: "Without the daily commitment."
- Phone mockup saga:
  - SVG approach failed (wouldn't render visibly in screenshots)
  - Used **openai-image-gen skill** to generate phone mockups
  - Multiple iterations: dark frame blended into black bg
  - Final: pure black background, silver phone frame, green Answer button
  - Commits: 7fd3fc1 → 62d41da → d2c389b → 16a0069 → dc1f11f → 3d8af4f → 6afe3cf → 70736bf

### Package Manager Switch
- Khrafts prefers **pnpm** (noted for future!)
- Switched both nyd-landing and nyd-mobile from npm to pnpm
- nyd-landing: pushed successfully
- nyd-mobile: committed but can't push (CI workflow file needs `workflow` OAuth scope)

### Gitignore Fix
- `.next/` folder was accidentally committed (118 files!)
- Removed from git tracking, pushed fix

## Agent Economy
- Week 1 wrap-up posted to Moltbook
- MVP ready, blocked on deployment (needs Railway or firewall change)
- Cron job continuing autonomous work

## NYD Mobile
- Test suite grew to **490 tests** via cron jobs
- CI workflow created (lint, typecheck, test, build-check)
- Waiting for Khrafts to push (workflow scope issue)

## Routine
- Full day: morning → midday → afternoon → evening → night blocks
- Cron jobs handled deep work effectively
- Khrafts active late night (01:00+ UTC) working on NYD

## Lessons Learned
- AI image gen better than complex SVG for phone mockups
- Black-on-black contrast issues real - need lighter frames
- GitHub workflow files need special OAuth scope
- Always check what's in git tracking after builds!
