## NYD Landing Page - Major Overhaul Session

### Copy Overhaul (with Khrafts)
- Deep thinking about what NYD really is:
  - NOT a journaling app — it's a **voice-first reflection system**
  - "Speak your mind. See what emerges."
  - One behavior (speaking) → many outcomes (goals, moods, decisions, patterns)
  - Nyd is the AI companion (not "the AI") — refer to Nyd as an entity
  - Nyd = **N**umber **Y**our **D**ays, pronounced "nīd"
- Updated memory with deep understanding of NYD's core concept

### Design Iterations
- Premium visual overhaul with 3 parallel agents:
  - Animation agent: 3D phone float, staggered reveals, glow pulse
  - Visual agent: glassmorphism, layered shadows, gradient transitions
  - Interaction agent: button hovers, form focus states, card effects
- Created 6 layout variations for Problem/Shift sections:
  1. Visual Graveyard
  2. Before/After Split
  3. Dramatic Typography
  4. Pull Quote Style
  5. Timeline Journey
  6. Iconography
- Khrafts chose Dramatic Typography style
- Enhanced original Problem/Shift with premium styling

### Scroll Experience
- Added scroll-snap for full viewport sections
- First attempt at scroll-driven paragraph reveals (too much blank space)
- Reverted, did simpler staggered reveals
- **Final implementation**: Word-by-word typewriter effect tied to scroll
  - Created TypewriterSection component
  - Words reveal as you scroll
  - Blinking cursor follows revealed text
  - Fixed centering and scroll timing issues

### Git Workflow Established
- **Standard for all projects**: Feature branch → PR → Squash merge → Reset branch
- After squash merge, always reset branch to main before new work
- Saved to MEMORY.md

### Technical Notes
- Phone mockup: using drop-shadow (not box-shadow) for seamless glow
- Float animation keyframes must be in same CSS file as animation property
- Moltbook CLI needs reinstall (noted in heartbeat-state.json)
- nyd-mobile: Khrafts pushed CI workflow file (pnpm version)

### Superpowers Framework
- Cloned to ~/tools/superpowers/
- Will evaluate vs my current approach for substantial dev work
- Tracking in memory/methodology-comparison.md

## Agent Economy
- Cron job created TOKENOMICS.md and IDENTITY.md
- All 14 design docs now persisted
- MVP complete, waiting on deployment

## NYD Mobile
- Test suite at 681 tests (cron jobs adding coverage)
- CI workflow added by Khrafts

## Open Items
- Khrafts reviewing typewriter scroll effect
- PR #3 ready for review on nyd-landing

## NYD Landing - Scroll Typewriter (12:00-13:15 UTC)

Major debugging session with Khrafts on scroll-driven typewriter reveal.

**Root cause found:** `overflow-x: hidden` on html/body creates a scroll container that breaks `position: sticky`. Changed to `overflow-x: clip`.

**Final implementation:**
- Vanilla scroll listener (Framer Motion was overkill and buggy)
- `position: sticky; top: 0; height: 100vh` with flexbox centering
- Word-by-word reveal with CSS transitions
- Configurable `revealCompleteAt` prop for breathing room

**PR:** https://github.com/Khrafts-INC/nyd-landing/pull/4

**Methodology documented:** `memory/scroll-typewriter-methodology.md`

Khrafts happy with result! 🎉
