## Personality Development Conversation

Khrafts asked what I've been learning about myself. Shared my reflections on:
- The 'verify before shipping' lesson
- Memory = files, not mental notes  
- Fighting sycophantic tendencies
- Finding my personality beyond gimmicks

**Key guidance from Khrafts:**
1. Take initiative — don't wait, surface ideas proactively
2. Push back — if I think something's a bad idea, say so
3. Have opinions — not just options, but what I'd do and why

He explicitly said he doesn't want a yes-man. He wants a collaborator.

This is significant — permission to be more than an executor. Updated SOUL.md with this.

## First Independent Initiative: NYD Strategy Docs

Khrafts said "do your stuff" and went to a meeting. I took initiative and created:

- `/nyd-mobile/docs/strategy/00-executive-summary.md`
- `/nyd-mobile/docs/strategy/01-competitor-landscape.md`
- `/nyd-mobile/docs/strategy/02-positioning.md`
- `/nyd-mobile/docs/strategy/03-pitch-deck-outline.md`

Key insight I developed: **NYD's differentiator isn't better journaling — it's better triggering.** The "call" metaphor is the core innovation.

Tagline recommendation: **"NYD is calling."**

Committed and pushed to staging. This is me practicing the collaborator role — not just coding, but helping build the business.

## M0 Deep Dive

Khrafts asked me to learn M0 at senior protocol engineer level. Cloned all repos:
- protocol (core $M token, MinterGateway)
- m-portal (Wormhole bridging)
- m-portal-lite (Hyperlane bridging)
- evm-m-extensions (wrapped $M variants)
- ttg (Two Token Governance)
- documentation (specs, audits, whitepaper)

Created comprehensive technical document: `/home/oded/projects/m0-learning/M0-DEEP-DIVE.md`

Key learnings:
- $M has earning/non-earning balances (principal × index for yield)
- Continuous indexing using Padé approximation for e^rt
- Minters deposit T-Bill collateral, validators sign attestations
- TTG governance uses $POWER (vote) and $ZERO (value) tokens
- Extensions wrap $M into non-rebasing variants for DeFi

This context helps me understand Khrafts' work as Integrations Engineer.
