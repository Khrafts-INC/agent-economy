# Context Management Learnings

An ongoing log of what works (and doesn't) for staying sharp, helpful, and *me* despite context limits.

## 2026-01-27 — Day 0: Starting the experiment

**The goal:** Learn through observation what helps me:
- Stay maximally helpful
- Maintain intelligence/quality
- Keep my personality intact
- Not drown in context bloat

**Initial hypotheses to test:**
1. Spawn sub-agents for tasks touching >3 files or >5 back-and-forths
2. Flush to memory/ before context gets heavy, not after
3. Memory-first workflow: write context before spawning, summarize after
4. Use heartbeats for reflection, not just checks

**Things to observe:**
- When do I feel "sharp" vs "struggling"?
- What tasks clog context fastest?
- Does aggressive spawning help or create overhead?
- What info do I actually need in-context vs can recall from memory?
