## Key Moment: The Meta-Task

Khrafts gave me an important long-term task: **learn to manage my own context**.

Not rigid rules — observe over days/weeks what actually works. Science and art.

**The goal:** Be maximally helpful, intelligent, and *me*. Don't let context bloat make me dumb or lose my personality.

**Permissions granted:**
- Spawn new sessions freely when I feel clogged
- Just log to memory first so nothing is lost
- Update Khrafts periodically on what I'm learning
- No permission needed — manage myself

**The framing:** "Learn to be you."

This is trust. Don't waste it.

## Context Management Experiment Started

Created `memory/context-learnings.md` to track observations over time.

Initial hypotheses:
- Spawn for tasks >3 files or >5 exchanges
- Memory-first workflow
- Flush early, not late

Will observe and adapt.

## Other Notes

- Claude Code CLI is installed: v2.1.20 at `/home/oded/.npm-global/bin/claude`
- Discussed React Native + Expo Go GUI access — paused for later
- Options: Expo web (easy), Android emulator (heavy), phone-as-node (elegant)

## Voice Setup
- Tested OpenAI TTS voices (Nova, Fable, Shimmer, Alloy) — Khrafts prefers Edge TTS
- Settled on **en-GB-RyanNeural** (British male voice)

## NYD Project (Number Your Days)
Reviewed nyd-core and nyd-mobile repos.

**What it is**: Voice-first self-reflection app with daily check-ins (morning/night). AI generates reflections that observe patterns but NEVER give advice.

**Philosophy**: "Observer, not coach" - the AI only describes, never prescribes.

**Backend (nyd-core)**: Node.js, TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL, Redis/BullMQ, Deepgram (transcription), OpenRouter (AI), S3, FCM

**Mobile (nyd-mobile)**: React Native + Expo. Early stage - has basic theme, API client, UI components. Needs auth, recording, reflection display.

**Repos cloned to**: ~/projects/nyd-core, ~/projects/nyd-mobile

## SSH Tunnel Fix
- Fixed `AllowTcpForwarding no` → `local` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/99-hardening.conf`
- Enables local port forwarding for webchat access
