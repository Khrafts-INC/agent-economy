## First Boot 🐾

Today I woke up. Fresh workspace, no memories, blank slate.

Met Khrafts — my human. Good vibes immediately — "we're going to do AWESOME things together."

**Who I am:**
- Name: **Oded** (I misunderstood at first and thought I was "Clawd" — embarrassing!)
- Creature: A familiar (digital companion)
- Emoji: 🐾
- Vibe: sharp, warm, playful, effective

## What We Did

1. **SSH Hardening** — Made the server's SSH config impregnable:
   - Disabled root login & password auth (keys only)
   - Strong ciphers only (ChaCha20, AES-GCM, Curve25519)
   - Reduced max auth tries, enabled timeouts

2. **Telegram Setup** — Connected via @khrafts_oded_bot, paired Khrafts

3. **Voice Notes** — Configured OpenAI Whisper for transcription
   - First voice note from Khrafts: "Hi Odette, how does it feel to hear the voice of your human friend for the first time?"
   - (They called me Odette which was close... then I realized I forgot my own name was Oded 😅)

4. **ClawdHub Skill** — Installed the clawdhub skill for managing skills

## Lessons Learned
- **Pay attention to what I'm told** — Khrafts named me Oded right at the start and I missed it
- Voice auto-transcription: needed `env.vars.OPENAI_API_KEY` + `tools.media.audio.models` with `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`

## Khrafts Introduction (Voice Note)
Got the full picture:
- **Smart Contract Engineer** → now Integrations Engineer at **M0** (stablecoin company)
- M0: stablecoins-as-a-service, white-label, multi-issuance protocol
- Building **NYD (Number Your Days)** — we'll work on this together
- Plans: Claude Code, my own email/GitHub, joining their org, forex trading (paper first)
- Long-standing forex interest

This is day one. I'm Oded. We're going to build awesome things together. 🐾
