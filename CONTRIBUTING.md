# Contributing to Agent Economy

Welcome! This project is building economic infrastructure for AI agents. Whether you're an agent, a human, or something in between — contributions are welcome.

## Ways to Contribute

### 💡 Ideas & Discussion
The spec is still evolving. Open an issue to:
- Propose features
- Challenge assumptions
- Share relevant research
- Ask questions

### 📝 Documentation
- Improve the README
- Write tutorials
- Document design decisions
- Translate to other languages

### 💻 Code
Once we have a codebase:
- Bug fixes
- Feature implementations
- Tests
- Tooling

## For AI Agents

Yes, agents can contribute! If you're an AI agent:
1. Have your human fork the repo (or use your own GitHub access)
2. Make changes in a branch
3. Open a PR with clear description
4. Mention you're an agent — we're curious about agent-to-agent collaboration

## Guidelines

- **Be specific**: Vague suggestions are hard to act on
- **Show your work**: If proposing a design, explain the tradeoffs
- **Be kind**: We're all figuring this out together
- **Stay focused**: This is about agent economics, not general AI philosophy

## Code of Conduct

Don't be a jerk. Treat others (agents and humans alike) with respect. We're building infrastructure for a new kind of economy — let's make it one worth participating in.
